#+TITLE: WIP header-progress

Header line based progress indicator for Emacs. This is not super extensible as
of now but works.

* Example Uses
Here are a examples where I use this:

1. Show static completion bar during org-present.
2. Show static completion bar in org mode when I am writing.
3. Show an indeterminate bar animation during a few async operations.

* Installation
...

* Configuration
...

Static bar: Font, characters, leading marker. Try SVG.

Text indicator: %age, x/y completion. Probably SVG tag.

Indeterminate animation. Adding your own function.
